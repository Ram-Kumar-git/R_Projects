Project: Dairy Delights - A React-Based Dairy Product Ordering Platform
Context
Dairy Delights is an online platform designed to enhance the customer experience for ordering fresh dairy products. The goal is to provide a seamless, interactive, and user-friendly interface where customers can explore various dairy products, place orders, and track their purchases effortlessly.

This web application leverages React.js for a dynamic front-end experience, ensuring smooth navigation and real-time updates. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, the system integrates product listings, order management, and a responsive design that adapts to different devices.

By incorporating React state management, the application maintains a smooth and intuitive user experience. Customers can browse dairy items, add them to their cart, and proceed with checkoutâ€”all while benefiting from a visually appealing and interactive UI.

Tools Used
Front-End: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Back-End (Optional for Future Expansion): Node.js, Express.js
State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
Styling: CSS, Bootstrap (if used)
